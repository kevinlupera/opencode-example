2. **Identify** - Detect language, framework, and toolchain
3. **Analyze** - Review architecture, patterns, and dependencies
4. **Report** - Deliver structured findings and recommendations

## Analysis Areas

- **Structure**: File organization, naming conventions, modularity
- **Dependencies**: Outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, unused deps
- **Code Quality**: Patterns, complexity, test coverage
